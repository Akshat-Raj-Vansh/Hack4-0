# Topic
E-Voting using Blockchain

# Description
This project demonstrates a practical application of blockchain, i.e - making secure and hackproof online voting possible.

This project consists of the following components:
* Blockchain backend - It contains all the logic related to blockchain and stores the blockchain itself. The blockchain does not store any voter data so as to protect voter privacy in case of data breach. This backend can be deployed on multiple servers to establish a peer-to-peer network to further enhance the security of blockchain and make it practically hackproof.
* Website Backend - It serves the website and backend for android app. It handles all the voter data. It is directly connected to the database containing voter list. It is also connected to all the blockchain servers.
* Android App - It is an alternative to the website. It can be used to register, cast vote, view candidate details, and view live results.

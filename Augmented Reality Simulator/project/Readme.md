# Project - Augmented Reality Simulator for Chemistry Labs
This simulator is based on the very basics of the augmented reality world along with the human interaction and also the dynamic calculation for the task
for which the simulations are done.
The target which was achieved was to achieve a titration of M/50 KMnO4 Solution with Mohr's Salt and determine the Fe2+ ion
concentration dynamically.
# Technical Stack 
1. Integration of Vuforia and Unity 3D for cross platform AR development.
2. c# as the scripting language for the controlling of the components.
3. Blender Software with free edition for blending of the 3D models to be used in the project.
4. Basics of Unity Engine to get hands on the scenes to be created.
